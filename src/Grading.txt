Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

Your program is missing the second verse, though, so I took
off two points for that.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the set of
methods that did the verses, and a comment for the set of
methods that did the individual lines within the verses.

Your program has excellent structure and top-notch efficiency.
Well done!
